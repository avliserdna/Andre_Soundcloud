## Project Name

"Life is Sound"

## Intro

"Life is Sound" is a music website that lets you upload music to fellow users, and listen to the music with them. As of the 1.0 build, the website allows users to share music to users and allow them to download it locally. It is an ever expanding website that takes inspiration from the website, Soundcloud. As such, it parallels in functionality with Soundcloud.

## How to Launch Locally

1. Clone/Download this project repository to your machine.
2. Extract the directory, and have two terminal windows ready (for Windows, make sure you're using WSL).
3. Install Node.js, SQLite, and Sequelize before running.
4. Once all have been insalled, cd into to the Andre_Soundcloud directory, then to the backend directory on your first terminal.
5. On the 2nd terminal, cd into the Andre_Soundcloud directory, then to the frontend directory.
6. Type npm_start on your backend directory, and wait for the backend services to run.
7. Type npm_start on your frontend directory, and wait for the frontend services to run too.

A local instance of the website should start after the npm start on the front end services. If you close your backend directory, data will not render properly on the frontend directory.
